Eyeblink Conditioning Interface
--------------------------------

This repository stores the code for running eyeblink conditioning experiments in mice. Capabilities include daq interfacing, 2-camera acqusition up to 120Hz, live monitoring and closed-loop trial initiation, and interfacing with two-photon microscopes for synchronization. All data are saved to HDF-5.

Usage notes:
------------

* Due to restrictions imposed by the CLEye driver, the software must be run in a 32-bit python installation if you want to use 2 cameras simultaneously
